#<a name="about-openEasySIS"></a>About openEasySIS
openEasySIS was created in order as a project to provide a local school system with a Student Information System (SIS)
Due to the nature of the project, this system was designed specifically for them but it can be scaled for other school environments.

This is a project for a Senior Projects class, and despite it being a learning experience we aim to provide a usable system that can be implemented in other environments.
